# Simple Projects Management 

## Overview

This TypeScript project is a versatile and user-friendly project management system developed with a strong emphasis on object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. The codebase embraces key OOP concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to enhance maintainability and readability. Additionally, design patterns, including the Singleton pattern, are strategically implemented to ensure efficient resource management.

## Features

- **Project Creation**: Users can create new projects by providing essential details such as project name, description, and the number of people involved.

- **Project Information**: Detailed information about each project, including its name, description, and team size, is easily accessible.

- **Intuitive Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Projects can be effortlessly moved between two lists, indicating whether they are active or inactive. This feature provides a visual representation of the project status and simplifies the management process.

## Object-Oriented Programming Approach

The project adheres to a comprehensive object-oriented programming (OOP) approach, leveraging key principles to create a modular and extensible codebase. The use of classes, encapsulation, and abstraction enhances the organization of code, making it more intuitive to understand and maintain.

## Design Patterns Implemented

### Singleton Pattern

The Singleton pattern is employed in strategic components of the system to ensure that only one instance of a class exists and to provide a global point of access to that instance. This pattern aids in managing shared resources efficiently and maintaining a centralized point of control for specific functionalities.

The Singleton pattern is particularly beneficial in scenarios where a single instance is required to coordinate actions across the application without the need for multiple instances.
